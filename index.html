        My name is Anuj Chaudhary, and Iâ€™m a BSc student in Data Science 
        and applications ðŸ§  at IIT, Madras ðŸŽ“.
        This website is a the collection of all the projects which I built
        while learning the basics of front-end development on Free Code Camp.
        freeCodeCamp is a community of people from all around the world who are
        learning to code together. It is a non-profit organization that offers
        a comprehensive and interactive platform for learning web development skills.
        I had created several projects based on different technologies such as HTML,
        CSS, SASS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery, React, Redux etc.
