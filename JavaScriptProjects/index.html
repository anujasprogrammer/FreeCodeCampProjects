        Developers use HTML and CSS to control the content and styling of 
        a page. And they use JavaScript to make that page interactive.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
        In this JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Course, 
        I learn the JavaScript fundamentals like variables, 
        arrays, objects, loops, functions, the DOM and more.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
        I also learnt about Object Oriented Programming (OOP), 
        Functional Programming, algorithmic thinking, how to 
        work with local storage, and how to fetch data using an API.

            Calorie Counter (Learn Form Validation)

    <p class="aboutproject">
        Sometimes, while coding a web application, programmers need to be 
        able to accept input from a user. In this calorie counter project, 
        I learned how to validate user input, perform calculations based on 
        that input, and dynamically update the interface to display the results.
     </p>
     <p class="aboutproject">
        In this practice project, I learned basic regular expressions, 
        template literals, the addEventListener() method, and more.

    <p class="aboutproject">
        JavaScript is a powerful scripting language that can be used to 
        make web pages interactive. It's one of the core technologies of 
        the web, along with HTML and CSS. 
     </p>
     <p class="aboutproject">
         In this practice project, I learned fundamental programming 
         concepts in JavaScript by coding my own Role Playing Game. 
         I learned how to work with arrays, strings, objects, functions, 
         loops, if/else statements, and more.
