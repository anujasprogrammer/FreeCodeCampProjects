        Developers use HTML and CSS to control the content and styling of 
        a page. And they use JavaScript to make that page interactive.

        In this JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Course, 
        I learn the JavaScript fundamentals like variables, 
        arrays, objects, loops, functions, the DOM and more.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also learnt about Object Oriented Programming (OOP), 
        Functional Programming, algorithmic thinking, how to 
        work with local storage, and how to fetch data using an API.

        JavaScript is a powerful scripting language that can be used to 
        make web pages interactive. It's one of the core technologies of 
        the web, along with HTML and CSS.Â

         In this practice project, I learned fundamental programming 
         concepts in JavaScript by coding my own Role Playing Game. 
         I learned how to work with arrays, strings, objects, functions, 
         loops, if/else statements, and more.
