        <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a> is a community of people from all around the world who are
        learning to code together. It is a non-profit organization that offers
        a comprehensive and interactive platform for learning web development skills.
        I had created several projects based on different technologies such as HTML,
        CSS, SASS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery, React, Redux etc.
