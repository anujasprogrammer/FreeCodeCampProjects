        Front End Libraries Projects
    </h1>
    <p class="description">
        After becoming familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I leveled 
        up my skills by learning some of the most popular front-end libraries 
        in the industry.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the Front End Development Libraries Certification, I learned how to 
        style websites quickly with Bootstrap. I also learned how to add logic 
        to CSS styles and extend them with SASS.
    </p>
    <p>
        Later, I build a shopping cart and other applications to learn how 
        to create powerful Single Page Applications (SPAs) with React 
        and Redux.
