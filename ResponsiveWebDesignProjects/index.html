    <h1>Responsive Web Design</h1>
    <span>
        In this course I learn languages that developers use to build 
        webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and 
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

        First I learn to build a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML
        and CSS. In later projects I learn modern techniques like CSS 
        variables by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility
        by building a quiz site.
        
        Finally, I learn how to make webpages that responds to different screen
        sizes by building a photo gallery with Flexbox, and a magazine article
        layout with CSS grid.
